Fintech Platform - Backend

This is the backend of the Fintech Platform, built using Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize ORM. It provides a secure API for user authentication, account management, transactions, and admin functionalities. The backend is hosted on Railway, with AWS PostgreSQL as the database, and EKS configured as a standby infrastructure.

Features

User Authentication using JWT-based authentication system
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Admin and user roles
Account Management where users can create and manage bank accounts
Transactions including deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds securely
Admin Features allowing admins to fetch all user data
RESTful API with well-structured endpoints for seamless frontend integration

Technologies Used

Node.js and Express.js as the backend framework
Sequelize ORM to handle database operations
